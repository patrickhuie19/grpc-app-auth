### Running the Server and Client

To give the code a try for the first time, you can run the server and client in two different terminals.

#### Server

Navigate to the server directory and run:

```bash
cd internal/examples/example-grpc-client-server/server
go run .
```

#### Client

Similarly, for the client:

```bash
cd internal/examples/example-grpc-client-server/client
go run .
```
